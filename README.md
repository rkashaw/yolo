This project utilizes the YOLO (You Only Look Once) deep learning model for object detection. The implementation is provided in a Jupyter Notebook (YOLO.ipynb) and includes steps for loading a pre-trained YOLO model, performing object detection on images or videos, and visualizing the results.

## Features
- Implementation of YOLO for real-time object detection.
- Pre-trained model usage for quick and efficient detection.
- Visualization of detected objects with bounding boxes.
- Customizable parameters for improved accuracy and performance.

## Requirements
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

bash
pip install opencv-python numpy torch torchvision matplotlib


Other dependencies may be required depending on the implementation in YOLO.ipynb.

## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
    bash
    jupyter notebook YOLO.ipynb
    
2. Follow the step-by-step instructions in the notebook to load the YOLO model and perform object detection.
3. Modify parameters as needed to test different configurations.

## Dataset
If a custom dataset is required, ensure it is properly formatted and specified in the notebook.

## Results
- The notebook will output images/videos with detected objects highlighted.
- Performance metrics such as accuracy and inference time may also be displayed.

## Future Improvements
- Fine-tuning on a custom dataset for higher accuracy.
- Implementing YOLOv5 or YOLOv8 for better performance.
- Optimizing model inference for real-time applications.
